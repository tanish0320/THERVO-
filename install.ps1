.SYNOPSIS
Install the Trace Commons contributor CLI on Windows.

.DESCRIPTION
The PowerShell counterpart to scripts/install.sh.

    irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TraceCommons/trace-commons-server/main/scripts/install.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1
    .\install.ps1

Reading it before running it is encouraged, which is why the two-step form is
documented first. There is deliberately no prettier URL yet: a redirect from
tracecommons.ai would be nicer to type and would add a second thing that can be
wrong, so this points at the one copy that exists.

WHAT THIS REFUSES TO DO

It will not install a binary it cannot verify. The published SHA-256 must match,
and the Authenticode signature must be valid AND name our organisation. There is
no -Force and no -SkipVerify: this tool reads your coding transcripts, so an
installer that can be talked into skipping the checks is worse than no
installer. On failure you get the reason, a non-zero exit, and nothing on your
PATH.

The checksum alone is weak -- it travels from the same origin over the same
connection as the binary, so it mostly catches corruption. The signature is the
stronger claim: it verifies against Microsoft's roots rather than against us, so
it still means something if this file or the binary were served by somebody else.

Checking the signer and not merely that a signature is present is the part that
matters. A validly signed binary from an unexpected publisher is exactly the case
a status-only check waves through.

.PARAMETER Dir
Where to install. Defaults to %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\TraceCommons.

.PARAMETER Version
Which release to install, e.g. 0.1.0. Defaults to the newest CLI release.
